The html file we create last week inspired me a lot, I've done this project mostly through replacing the the existing modules.

#I copied this part from last week's file.

Sorry Rachel, I am super sick right now, can't make it to the class.

#I simply just replace the text within the module.

  <h2>Have to do this project all by myself.</h2>

   Again, simply replace the hyperlink with my own.

  <img src="This is my cat.gif"width="450"height="600"> 
  Putting a gif into the website is by far the hardest part for me.I have to convert the picture to gif form and adjust the width and height to resize it and let it fit with the whole website.I searched for how to achieve that, and I know that I could add "width" and "height" module within the <imgsrc=> to resize the picture.
